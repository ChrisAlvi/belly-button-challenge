Here's a well-structured paragraph for your GitHub README:  



This project involves building an interactive dashboard to explore the dataset, which catalogs the microbial species (OTUs) found in human navels. Using JavaScript and the D3 library, this dashboard dynamically visualizes microbial data through interactive charts. Features include a horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 OTUs for a selected individual, a bubble chart showing the distribution of all detected OTUs, and a demographic panel presenting metadata. The dashboard updates in real-time when a new sample is selected.
